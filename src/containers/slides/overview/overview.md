#### CSS Grid Overview

CSS Grid, a technology over a decade in the making, allows us to create responsive, easy-to-change layouts. Recently embraced by all major web browsers, CSS Grid, combined with Flexbox, empowers us to design beautiful, adaptable websites.

To understand the value CSS Grid brings, let's rewind to our past layout creation methods.

In the early days of CSS, most front-end developers used floats for layout design. Originally intended for text flow around images, floats were co-opted for layout creation due to the lack of better alternatives. We faced numerous challenges, resorting to workarounds like clearfix hack, overflow: hidden trick, and even resorting to display: table or display: inline-block. Despite these tricks, we still had to heavily rely on media queries to make our websites responsive.

With the introduction of Flexbox, we gained a powerful tool for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns). This advancement significantly eased our design process. The Bootstrap framework, developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, was a game-changer. Incorporating Flexbox into its grid system, Bootstrap streamlined the creation of responsive designs.

That brings us to the present, with CSS Grid in our toolbelt. Although not a new technology, CSS Grid has recently gained widespread browser support and is set to revolutionize how we construct web layouts. Unlike previous methods, CSS Grid offers a true two-dimensional system (rows and columns), reducing our dependence on workarounds and providing a more intuitive layout design experience.
